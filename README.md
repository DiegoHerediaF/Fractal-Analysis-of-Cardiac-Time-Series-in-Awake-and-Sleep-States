# Fractal-Analysis-of-Cardiac-Time-Series-in-Awake-and-Sleep-States
Using hurst exponent and its relationship with fractal dimension H=2-D, cardiac time series at 3 different altitudes of 14 subjects, without any cardiopathy, are characterized in sleep and awake states. Using surrogate data method, it is also shown that these time series are temporally fractal.
